OpenSSH is an open source suite for SSH, a cryptographic network protocol 
for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. 

OpenSSH can install a client and also a server. 

- To check if you have the client installed, issue this command: `which ssh`
- To check if you have the server installed, issue this command: `which sshd`

### Installation

- Client: `sudo apt install openssh-client`
- Server: `sudo apt install openssh-server`

### Basic usage

- Connect to remote machine:

`ssh user@remote_machine_ip`

- Note: if the remote machine you used to ssh has been deleted and a new system has been installed in the same remote machine with the same user and IP address, issue this command:

`ssh-keygen -R 34.122.142.165 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts`

- Generate a Key Pair:

`ssh-keygen`

- Copy the Public Key to remote machine(example: id_rsa.pub):

`ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user@remote_machine_ip`

- How to copy a file from local to remote (from local shell):

`scp file_name user@remote_machine_ip:/home/remoteuser/`

- How to copy a file from remote to local (from local shell):

`scp user@remote_machine_ip:file_name /home/localuser/`

### Advanced usage

#### How to connect over the internet

If you want to ssh connect with a machine over the internet, these are 
the basic settings:

1. Port **22** must be open. If you have 
[ufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW) running, 
open port 22: `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`

2. Obtain your IP address.

Type `ip addr | grep inet` to get your ip address. If it starts with 
`192.168.`, `172.16.` up to `172.31.`, or `10.`, you have a local 
(aka private) ip address. Otherwise it is public (eg 74.125.224.51). 
If it is public, you have it easy. Anyone can try and connect with a 
command like `ssh bob@74.125.224.51`.

If you are stuck with a local IP address, you need to configure your 
router to forward port 22 to your computer. Then you can go to a site 
like [http://whatismyip.org/](http://whatismyip.org/) to get your 
public ip address, and anyone who has it can try and connect with a 
command like `ssh bob@74.125.224.51`.

3. Get a permanent IP address

Sign up with [http://dyndns.com/](http://dyndns.com/) for their free 
Host Services to link a dyndns name to your ip address. I'm assuming 
here that you have not bought a static ip address from your ISP.
