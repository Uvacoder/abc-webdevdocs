## How to query several images from source files

**Case example**: How to get all files with extension ".webp" and ".jpeg" from directory "images"

1. On *gatsby-configure.js*, configure *gatsby-source-filesystem* plugin in order to fetch data from particular directories, in this case */images/*

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/images/`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

2. Create the query. Note that in order to filter by directory, we actually use the *name* you specified in the *gatsby-config.js* file by using the filter *sourceInstanceName* in the query:
```js
export const query = graphql`
  query MyQuery {
    allFile(filter: {sourceInstanceName: {eq: "images"}, extension: {regex: "/(jpeg)|(webp)/"}}) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          relativePath
        }
      }
      totalCount
    }
  }
`
```

Note that *relativePath* will yield the actual name of the file.
