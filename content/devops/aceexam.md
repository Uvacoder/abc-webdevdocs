## GCP Compute

* **App Engine**: Run applications for you (no need to configure servers or other resourses) - PaaS
* **Compute Engine**: virtual machines - IaaS
* **Kubernetes Engine**: orchestration platform that manages clusters and organize how containers can run efficiently on a cluster
* **Cloud Functions**: serverless, event-driven computing service

## GCP Storage

* NoSQL Databases
  + **Bigtable**: wide column database
  + **Datastore**: document database designed to store and query JSON-like documents
  + **Firestore** (next generation): document database 
* Relational Databases
  + **SQL**: Managed database service (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
  + **Spanner**: Horizontally scalable global relational database
* File System
  + **Filestore**: Managed network file system (good for sharing)
* Object System
  + **Storage**: Data pockets for large amount of unestructured data.

**Hierarchy**

Organization -> Folder -> Project -> Resources

# IAM

## Identity

Represents a user or entity that has privileges to perform actions in GCP. There are 4 types of identities:

### Google Account

* Represents developer, admin or other person. 
* Email address associate with Google: myusername@gmail.com

### Cloud Identity or G Suite Account

* G Suite user is a member of an organization's G Suite domain
* Cloud Identity like G Suite domain, but without access to G Suite services.

### Google Group

* Collections of identities
* Useful for assigning roles to multiple users
* Identities in group acquire roles assigned to the group
* Identities lose roles when removed from group

### Service Account

* Account associated with an application or instance rather than a user
* Can create as many as needed
* Represented as an email: 727080621142-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

## Access Control Concepts

* Resources
* Permissions
* Roles
  + Predefined
  + Custom
  + Primitive

## Policies

* Collections of statements that define which users have access to some resource
* Attached to a resource
* Roles attached to identitites, policies attached to resources
* Policy hierarchy

# Compute Engine

## Instance Groups

* Collection of instances that are managed as single entity
* 2 Types:
  + managed instance group
  + unmanaged instance group

	

### Managed Instance Group

  + Multiple identical VMs
  + Configuration defined in instance template

Features:

  + Autoscaling
  + Autohealing
  + Multi-zone deployments
  + Auto-updating

### Unmanaged Instance Group (for legacy clusters)

  + Multiple possibly heterogeneous VMs
  + Used to apply load balancing accross heterogenerous group of instances
  + In generl, recommended for legacy clusters only
  + No autoscaling, autohealing, or auto-updating

### Autoscaling Configuration

  + Automatically add or remove instances based on workload
  + Set minimum and maximum number of instances
  + Based on target utilization
    - CPU utilization
    - HTTP load balancing servicing capacity
    - Stackdriver metrics

# Kubernetes Engine

* Managed service
* Provides Kubernetes Clusters
* Kubernetes
  + Runs containers on cluster of virtual or physical machines (VMs in GCP)
  + Known as container orchestration

### Features

  + Load balancing of workloads
  + Node pools to segment nodes within a cluster
  + Automatic scaling and updating
  + Stackdriver monitoring

### Kubernetes Process Objects

Services wraps Deployments which consists of Pods.

  + **Pods**:	Mecanism to encapsulate and run a container
  + **Deployment**: Especification of how pods run (pod replicas, etc)
  + **Services**: Mecanism for service discovery. For example, a way of assosiating a particular IP with a particular pod.

### Kubernetes Storage Objects

  + Persistent Volumes
  + Persistent Volume Claims
	
# App Engine

* Platform as a Service
* Serveless managed service
* Well suited to run microservices
* Originally limited to language specific runtimes
* Can now run containers
* Two types:
  + App Engine Standard
  + App Engine Flexible

### App Engine Standard

* Run applications in preconfigured containers
* Applications run in secure sandbox
* Autoscales
* Standard Runtines: Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Go
* Components: Application, Service, Version and Instance

### App Engine Flexible

* Runs customized Docker containers
* Not as restricted as sandbox used in App Engine Standard
* Support for Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and other languages but can be customized
* Run locally without App Engine SDK
* Custom health checks
* Higher CPU and memory limits
* Applications are run in regional managed instance groups, not zonal managed instance groups

### App Engine Scaling

* Applications execute on App Engine managed instances
* Scale based on load when running dynamic instances
* Cona configure resident instances to run at all times but when autoscaling enabled, use dynamic instances

#### Configuring Autoscaling

* Configured in `app.yaml` 
* Configuration options include:
  + Target_cpu_utilization
  + Target_throughput_utilization
  + Max_concurrent_requests
  + Max_pending-latency
  + Min_pending_latency

### App Engine Traffic Splitting

* If more than one version of an app is running, you can scplit traffic between versions
* 3 ways to split traffic
  + IP address
  + HTTP cookie
  + Random selection

####  Traffic Splitting by IP address

* Provides stickiness so all traffic from IP address handled by same instances
* Can create problems if state is maintained and user changes IP address

#### Traffic Splitting by Cookie (preferred)

* HTTP request header for cookie named GOOGAPPUID contains hash value
* Hash value determines instance to route traffic too
* Tolerates user changing IP address

#### Traffic Splitting by Random Selection

* Useful for stateless applications
* No need to ensure traffic from a client always goes to the same instance
* Used when no GOOGAPPUID cookie

 

# Cloud Functions

* Serveless compute service
* Execute code in response to events based on triggers
* Available for events in:
  + Cloud Storate
  + Cloud Pub/Sub
  + HTTP
  + Firebase
  + Stackdriver Logging

### Events

* Storage
  + Upload
  + Delete
  + Archive
* Cloud Pub/Sub
  + Publish a message
* HTTP
  + POST

  + DELETE
  + OPTIONS

### Triggers

* Declaration of interest in an event
* Bind function to a trigger to execute it
* May be associated with a resource
  + Cloud Storage bucket
  + Cloud Pub/Sub topic
  + Etc

### Functions

* Node.js
* Python
* Go
