### How to convert PNG to SVG

1. File ➡ Import
2. Choose to "embed" the image.
3. Select the image with the select tool (↖).
4. Path ➡ Trace Bitmap ➡ Multiple scans ➡ Colors:
  * Scans: 2
  * Remove Background checked
5. Select "Update" for a preview until settings are fine.
6. Start tracing with "OK".

Now a vectorized image of your original bitmap will be seen on top of the bitmap. We can resize or move this newly created object, delete the original image, or choose to "Object - Ungroup" in case we need to adapt shapes or colour of sub-object created.

7. If necessary, reduce size of the vectorized image (hold down CTRL to lock ratio), so that it fits on the page. Otherwise it may appear "cropped" when viewed.
8. Use "File - Save As" to save your file in SVG format.
